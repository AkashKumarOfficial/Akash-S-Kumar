<h2> Did the Red Bull Racing F1 team make the right call by switching Pierre Gasly out for Alexander Albon?</h1>


<body class="content">
	<p>The Red Bull Racing F1 team have switched Pierre Gasly out for Alexander Albon during the summer break of the 2019 F1 season. This article will elaborate on why this decision was made as the Red Bull F1 team's boss Christian Horner said that Gasly was safe till the end of the 2019 season.<br>

<h3> The options that they could've chosen from were:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Keeping Gasly till the end of the season</li>
		<li>Switching Gasly out for Albon</li>
		<li>Switching Gasly out for Kvyat</li>
	</ul>
	<p> The main reason why they made the switch was because Gasly was not proving his worth in the superior Red Bull car as he was underperforming massively and was not able to extract the full potential out of the Red Bull car as he had only around 80 driver's chamionship points compared to his team-mate Max Verstappen's 181. This indicates that Red Bull simply couldn't afford to lose out on the constructor's championsip therefore they needed to get a driver who can challenge the other teams and Verstappen as well as so far this season, the only realistic challenge he has got was from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, Sebastian Vettel and Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas. </p>

<p> Alexander Albon is on his rookie season and he doesn't have much experience in an F1 car; he has also been beaten by his team-mate Daniil Kvyat during his days in Red Bull Toro Rosso. However Alex has proven to be a very consistant driver over at Toro Rosso and it is safe to say that he has challenged his team-mate enough that considering that this is his first season in Formula 1. Making this driver transfer puts a lot of pressure on Alex however when he himself was interviewed, he seemed to be looking forward with the rest of the season with Red Bull and even though there is a lot of pressure in his hands, he just wants to make the best out of his opportunity.</p>

	<p style="float: right; max-width: 46%; margin-left:5px; margin-top: -20px;">Daniil Kvyat has also has a good history in Formula 1 as he has been performing very well and has proved to be a fast and consistant driver. He has raced for Scuderia Toro Rosso, Red Bull Racing’s sister team in 2014 and then he got promoted up to Red Bull Racing in the 2015 season where he even had the opportunity to battle with the current four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel. He made a mistake during the 2016 season (his second season with Red Bull) where he made contact twice in the same corner in the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix with Vettel, leading to a disaster day for Red Bull as Kvyat’s teammate Daniel Riccardo also got held up in the melee between Kvyat and Vettel as at the end of the day, both of them finished outside of the points. However, this is not the only reason why Red Bull have chosen not to sign Kvyat back into Red Bull for the 2019 season. Another reason is beacause Red Bull are trying to get young and talented drivers into their team before they get lost to a rival team. This is what they tried with Max Verstappen and it seems that they really did get a talented young driver. What Red Bull have done is simply tried it again with Piere Gasly however it didn't work very well because of his pace compared to his team-mate. Red Bull's hopes are now laid on wether or not Albon will be able to challenge Max Verstappen as he hasn't had a challenge from his team-mate since the 2018 F1 season. So far however, Alexander Albon has been showing very consistant pace in the Red Bull car. He still hasn't had a chance to fight Verstappen properly in a race however he has recovered from the back of the grid to P5 twice now and that shows some serious skill. Albon has not finished outside of P5 so far during his time at Red Bull even when he spun out and crashed in Q1 at Sochi, he recovered from a pitlane start all the way up to P5.<br></p>
	<br>
		<p style="float: right;">As for wether or not Red Bull are going to keep Albon for the 2020 season is uncertain as Red Bull's boss Christian Horner said that they still have a lot more to monitor from Albon and to be fair he needs to get a chance to fight his team-mate on track to see wether or not he races decently.<p><br>

	<p> The Red Bull Racing F1 team could have also chosen to keep Gasly till the end of the season, especially considering Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner stated before the summer break that Gasly was safe until the end of the 2019 F1 season. However it is important to note that Red Bull not only cannot afford to have an underperforming driver on their team, but also the immense amount of pressure that was laid on Gasly's hands from the media which could've resulted in him not being able to concentrate on unleasing the potential both in himself, and the car. Pierre Gasly was therefore given more time to rebuild his confidence, just in a different car where it doesn't matter as much if he underperforms. Although realistically speaking Gasly doesn't have a chance to get back into the Red Bull car, it could still be possible only if he shows to be a true talent in the Toro Rosso for the rest of the season.k</p>
